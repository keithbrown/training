This course provides a hands-on approach to learning xtUML.  We will use xtUML Editor from 
xtuml.org as our modeling environment.  xtUML Editor is built on eclipse.  The download package 
contains everything you need to get started.

xtUML Editor is available for both Windows and Linux.  Next we'll discuss the installation steps 
for each operating system in detail.
