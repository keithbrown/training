- The xtUML editor supports inter-project referencing
- This allows for elements under one project to refer to elments from all other projects
- To enable inter-project referencing right click on the project in the Model Explorer view, than choose the Project Preferences action
- In the dialog that is presented check the Allow inter-project model references button
- Next click the OK button
- Now the project can refer to elements from other projects in the workspace
- These elements include Data Types, Components and External entities
- To add an external reference to a data type we set the type of another element
- In this case we will choose an attribute
- Right click on the attribute and select the Set Type... action
- In the opened dialog we can see by the element path that data types defined in the GPS Watch model are present
- Choose the desired data type and then click the OK button
- In the properties view we can now see that the Location attribute has been set as the type
- To add a component reference we first draw the component reference
- Then we right click on the component reference and choose the Assign Component... action
- In the dialog that is presented we will see a list of components defined in the GPS Watch project
- We will choose a component to refer to and then click the OK button
- We now see a component reference of the defined component in the GPS Watch project
- We can also see an imported interface reference that is formalized to an interface from the GPS Watch project
- To reference external entity bridges from another project you simply add OAL as you would if the External Entity was local
- For this example we will add OAL to an operation in the GPS Integration project
