- When using inter-project references in the xtUML editor synchronization must be done manually
- This is to handle the cases where a single group does not own the entire system
- When a referred to element is changed the referring elements will have warning symbols added to the Model Explorer tree
* Delete setTime operation
* Add stopTest operation
- These warning symbols aid in determining when your local project is out of sync
* To synchronize your project with the referred to element right click on the project in Model Explorer
* Next select the Synchronize with library action
- You will be presented with a dialog that warns about any removals that will occur in the synchronization
- At this point you can either cancel the synchronization or you can accept the changes and click the OK button
- Checking the Do not ask again button will prevent this dialog from showing
* Check the Do not ask again button
- The dialog can be re-enabled in the xtUML editor preferences
- Once you hit OK the synchronization will complete
- You are again presented with a dialog that gives you a description of what was done
- In addition to any removals you will also see any additions that were made
- Again you may click the Do not ask again button to prevent this dialog from showing, and of course can re-enable it in the xtUML preferences
- Once done the warning markers will be removed from the tree and the model will be synchronized
- All synchronizations support undo and redo
- Once a synchronization is undone the warning symbols will return
- If redone the warning symbols will be removed
- The aforementioned process is used to synchronize in a pull fashion
- Another approach is to push the synchronization if you are the owner of all referring projects
- To push the synchronization right click on the project and select the Synchronize with references action
- After the action is complete all referring projects will be synchronized
